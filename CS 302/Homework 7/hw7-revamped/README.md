###TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) 
The functions needed for the TSP were contained within a header/class. I felt this made it 
easier to control the variables needed for the problem without making them global. 
The most efficient path along with all possible paths were included in "paths.txt"
main.cpp was only for calling the functions to write the paths to the file.
