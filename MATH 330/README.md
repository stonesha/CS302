# Extra Credit Assignment for MATH 330

##Prompt

Heading (i.e., direction) is measured in terms of degrees in the interval [0°,360°); airspeed (indicated/true — learn the difference between the two!) is measured in terms of knots (i.e., nautical miles per hour); altitude above mean sea level is measured in terms of feet; and outside air temperature is measured in terms of degrees Celsius.

A pilot wishes to fly from Point A to Point B at an indicated airspeed of v knots and at an altitude of h feet. The vector from Point A to Point B has direction θ°. From meteorological reports, the pilot knows that the wind at the altitude he wishes to fly has direction φ° (i.e., blowing from φ°) and speed w knots (relative to the ground), and that the outside air temperature at that altitude is T °C.

With v, w, h, θ, φ, and T as your given data, write a computer program (using Microsoft Excel or a computing software of your choice) that enables you to determine (1) the heading toward which the pilot must point his aircraft in order to fly a straight course from Point A to Point B, and (2) his aircraft’s ground speed, i.e., speed relative to the ground (because of the presence of wind, this will not, in general, be equal to his aircraft’s true airspeed).

As air density decreases with altitude and outside air temperature, and as an airspeed indicator is affected by air density, indicated airspeed will not be equal to true airspeed unless the aircraft is situated at mean sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere. Therefore, you must find out (using Wikipedia or any other resource) how air density changes with altitude and outside air temperature, and how readings taken from an airspeed indicator are affected by air density.

This project will test your ability to handle vectors, as well as your knowledge of basic trigonometry, engineering, atmospheric science, and computer programming. You may work in groups of up to four people. The deadline for submission of your program is 12:00pm on May 14.
